% matrices as well as the current state and current subcond, determine the
% next state using a probabilistic method and return also the most likely
% next state, even if not realized
% INPUT:
% - T an input structure with substructures containing {M}(N by N} matrices
% with M = number of subconds and N = possible current (row) and future
% (columns) states. Each matrice is under the string form to be evaluated
% based on the "noise" parameter.
% - cond: an index of the condition. Determines with T{cond} substructure
% should be used.
% - noise: the amount of noise in the transition matrices.
% - scurrent: current state.
% - subcond: current subcond.
